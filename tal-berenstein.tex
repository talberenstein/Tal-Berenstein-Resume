\noindent \emph{Senior Software Engineer at Volvo Group.
Expert in enabling software delivery, optimizing workflows, and leading multicultural teams to success. I combine an entrepreneurial spirit with a people-first approach to engineering leadership.}
\\
\\
With a technical foundation established in \emph{Valparaíso, Chile}, and academic training at \emph{Universidad Diego Portales} in \emph{Santiago}, I have developed a career defined by continuous technical evolution. My expertise spans system administration and core languages including Typescript, Java, Python, and \CPP. My commitment to agile practices was established early at a Brazilian startup and formalized as a Professional Scrum Master\texttrademark.

Extensive freelance work across Oceania and Asia honed my ability to deliver technical solutions within diverse multicultural environments and expanded my linguistic skills in Portuguese, English, and Swedish. Currently, I balance technical leadership with active development at Volvo Group Connected Solutions. While managing a team of Front-end developers and designers, I remain a hands-on engineer, actively contributing to the codebase and driving technical delivery. I am also enhancing my strategic overview through the \href{https://www.globalleadership.com/en/}{\acr{Global Functional Leaders}} program in Gothenburg.
